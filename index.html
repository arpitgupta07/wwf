    For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature<br>
    As the world’s leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we<br> 
    collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect <br>
    communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.

<blockquote>
    WWF works to help local communities conserve the natural resources they depend upon; transform markets and policies toward sustainability;<br>
    and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a<br>
    global scale.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    WWF connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field, more than 1 million supporters in the<br>
    United States and 5 million globally, and our partnerships with communities, companies, and governments.

<blockquote>
    Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but it’s also humans who have the power to change this trajectory.<br>
    Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.
